## Running

### Locally

- install node
- extract these files into a folder
- navigate to that folder via terminal
- type "npm install"

That should install all the node npm packages needed to run the script. You can modify the settings in r.js./ line 51

Setting start to 0 should start you on the current day. Setting end to 1 should collect 2 days (day 0 & 1). I believe setting pages sets a max page count. There can be multiple pages per day.

- type "npm start" 

that will run the scraper in a custom chrome browser.

### Docker

- docker build -t pdap/palm-beach-scraper .
- docker run --it pdap/palm-beach-scraper
